# Game Tools Tutorial
An overview of all of my modern game tools (released in 2023+) all tools will share the same UI and settings going forward.

> **NOTICE:** If you're having trouble running the tools, see troubleshooting at the bottom of this page.

## üìÇ Loading a file
If the game tool supports loading assets from specific files, you'll see a "Load File" button at the bottom of the window. In addition, you can also drag and drop a supported file anywhere on the UI to load it.

## üéÆ Loading a game
If the game tool supports loading assets from a running instance of a game, you'll see a "Load Game" button at the bottom of the window. You must launch the game first, then click the "Load Game" button. The game must remain running while you export assets.

## üíæ Exporting one or more assets
To export an asset you can:
- Double click an asset in the list.
- Select the assets you want to export and press `(E)`.
- Select the assets you want to export and press "Export Selected" button.
- Press the "Export All" button.

The cancel button will cancel the export job after the current asset exports.

## üîç Previewing an asset
To preview an asset, you can press `(P)` to open the preview window. Select the asset you want to view in the list of assets to preview it. You can change the controls in settings.

- Viewport Controls (Autodesk Maya):
  - `Ctrl/Alt + Left Mouse` = Rotate.
  - `Ctrl/Alt + Middle Mouse` = Pan.
  - `Ctrl/Alt + Right Mouse` = Zoom.
- Viewport Controls (Blender):
  - `Middle Mouse` = Rotate.
  - `Shift + Middle Mouse` = Pan.
  - `Alt + Middle Mouse` = Zoom.

If you hold `Alt` while selecting an asset to preview, it will allow you to preview the asset as if it's a raw file, instead of a converted asset.

## üïµÔ∏è Searching for assets
You can search for assets using text, or specially formatted text commands to narrow down your search. Each command must be separated by a comma `,` and up to 5 commands can be searched for at once. By default, a property command value is assumed to be equal, but you can use the operators `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` to change that.

- Search asset properties:
  - `bonecount` Searches the bonecount property, usually for models.
    - Defaults to 0 for non-supported assets.
    - Supports `>`, `<`, and equals.
  - `meshcount` Searches the meshcount property, usually for models.
    - Defaults to 0 for non-supported assets.
    - Supports `>`, `<`, and equals.
  - `framecount` Searches the framecount property, usually for animations.
    - Defaults to 0 for non-supported assets.
    - Supports `>`, `<`, and equals.
  - `framerate` Searches the framerate property, usually for animations.
    - Defaults to 0 for non-supported assets.
    - Supports `>`, `<`, and equals.
  - `width` Searches the width property, usually for images.
    - Defaults to 0 for non-supported assets.
    - Supports `>`, `<`, and equals.
  - `height` Searches the height property, usually for images.
    - Defaults to 0 for non-supported assets.
    - Supports `>`, `<`, and equals.
  - `channels` Searches the channels property, usually for sounds.
    - Defaults to 0 for non-supported assets.
    - Supports `>`, `<`, and equals.
- Search asset names:
  - By default, search will check if the name contains the given text.
  - If you prefix your text with `!`, it will check if the name does not contain the given text.

### Examples
Search for an asset with the name `normal` that is at least 2048x2048:
```
width:>=2048,height:>=2048,normal
```
Search for an asset with exactly 100 bones, and doesn't have `fire` in the name:
```
bonecount:100,!fire
```

## üìã Handy asset shortcuts
- `Ctrl + C` Copy the names of all selected assets to the clipboard.
- `Ctrl + F` Focuses the search box and selects all of it's content.

## üö¶ Asset status
- Loaded - The asset is ready to be exported.
- Placeholder - The asset is empty, a reference, or has nothing to export at this time.
- Not Supported - The asset is currently not supported for export.
- Exporting - The asset is currently exporting in parallel.
- Exported - The asset was exported successfully.
- Error - An error occured while exporting this asset, you should report the name of it to me. (Make sure you didn't run out of disk space.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tool Settings
Here is a list of all of the configurable tool settings and a description that goes with it:

### Settings - General
- Load Models - Show assets that are models.
- Load Animations - Show assets that are animations.
- Load Images - Show assets that are images.
- Load Materials - Show assets that are materials.
- Load Sounds - Show assets that are sounds.
- Load Raw Files - Show assets that are loose files, or not directly convertable.

You can customize the export directory using the "Browse" button.

- Automatically scale assets - Scales assets from in-game units to source / editor units (Recommended).
  - If the game uses meters, then the units will be `*= 100`.
  - If the game uses inches, then the units will be `*= 2.54`.
  - If the game uses centimeters, then the units will be `*= 1.0`.
- Custom scale - Applies a user provided scale factor to the assets: `*= factor`.

### Settings - Models
- Cast - Export models in cast format. [Plugins](https://github.com/dtzxporter/cast)
- OBJ - Export models in obj format.
- Valve SMD - Export models in smd format. [Maya SDK](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Maya#Source_SDK_plug-ins) / [Blender SDK](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Blender_Source_Tools)
- XNALara - Export models in xnalara format. [Blender 3.x](https://github.com/johnzero7/XNALaraMesh) / [Blender 4.x](https://github.com/Valerie-Bosco/XNALara-io-Tools)
- CoD XModel - Export models in xmodel_export format.
- Autodesk Maya - Export models in ma format. [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya)
- FBX - Export models in fbx format.

> **WARNING:** Some model formats only support a limited amount of model features. For the best compatibility with any game, use Cast with a proper plugin.

### Settings - Images
- Image file type `DDS`:
  - Typically the source format for the game.
  - Supports both sRGB and linear textures.
  - Requires latest [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/) or [Photoshop Plugin](https://github.com/GameTechDev/Intel-Texture-Works-Plugin).
  - Does not work properly in Blender or Maya and many other editors.
- Image file type `PNG`:
  - Lossless converted from in-game formats.
  - Supports both sRGB and linear textures.
  - This is a recommended format.
- Image file type `TIFF`:
  - Lossless converted from in-game formats.
  - Supports both sRGB and linear textures.
  - This is a recommended format.
- Image file type `TGA`:
  - Sometimes lossless converted from in-game formats.
  - Does not contain color space information.
  - Will be significantly larger than any other format.

Normal map conversion aids in reconstructing normal maps from the game. Does not affect the previewer.

- Normal map conversion `None`:
  - Does nothing to transform the normal maps.
- Normal map conversion `OpenGL`:
  - Regenerates the Z channel from XY like the game does.
  - Ensures that Y is facing the correct "OpenGL" direction.
- Normal map conversion `DirectX`:
  - Regenerates the Z channel from XY like the game does.
  - Ensures that Y is facing the correct "DirectX" direction.

### Settings - Animations

  - Lossless and will take up less space than the wavs.

### Settings - Advanced
- Treat all assets as raw files (Not Recommended).
  - Forces all assets to load and display as-is without conversion.

## üêû Troubleshooting
If you're having trouble running the tools here are a few things you can try:

#### The tools won't open, or open and immediately crash:
If nothing shows at all, or a blank window appears briefly, this usually indicates a driver problem. The solution is updating _both_ your dedicated (if you have one) and integrated gpu drivers. The tools are designed to pick the best device you have, and some older intel/amd drivers have known bugs initializing some graphics apis.

Some game overlay / performance tools mistake the tools for being a game, due to the way the ui is drawn. Disabling them or blacklisting the tools can also resolve issues.

If all else fails, or you just don't have a working graphics card built in the last 15 years, you can try to run the tools using Google's `SwiftShader`. You need to place the `vk_swiftshader.dll` file next to the tool and rename it to `vulkan-1.dll` before launching. This will work, but may have performance issues and may not support all texture types, but should allow you to still use the tools.

#### Every single asset says 'Error' when exporting:
If every single asset fails to export, this is most likely because your output directory isn't writable, you ran out of disk space, or you forgot to extract the tool from the zip file before running it. Double check, and also set a custom export directory path in settings if necessary.

#### Using the tools on linux results in bad gui scaling:
If you're using a linux build of a tool, and the tool appears too large you can set the following environment variables before running the tool:
- `WINIT_UNIX_BACKEND=x11`
- `WINIT_X11_SCALE_FACTOR=1`

#### I have a problem not listed here:
If you have an issue not listed here, join the discord server, and describe exactly what you're experiencing. Include crash files, if they exist and the steps you took to reproduce the issue.
