# Hunter - The TD, TD2, AFOP, XDEF, SWOL Asset Extractor
Extracts all assets from the games "The Division", "The Division 2", "Avatar Frontiers of Pandora", "XDefiant", and "Star Wars Outlaws". This software was developed by [DTZxPorter](https://twitter.com/dtzxporter).

## ❤️ Donate:
- I take time out of my day to make this happen.
- Show your support: [HERE](https://dtzxporter.com/donate)

## 💾 Download and version info:

> **IMPORTANT:** This software comes with no warranty what so ever. Use at your own risk.

- Download (Windows x64): [Hunter (v2.18)](https://mega.nz/file/pEJkgAba#Wjmc6fYzvTHrN0lRWlQXIgacZ-tZsSp3MoVIKLsASP4).
  - Windows 10+ officially supported.

## 👉 Usage:
Read the new game tools tutorial: [Game Tool Tutorial](https://dtzxporter.com/game-tools-tutorial).

> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the rogue/hunter folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

## ⚙️ Ripping:
- The **.sdftoc** files contain various encoded assets that Hunter can export; and, as of now the currently supported assets are:
  - Textures as [Dds, Png, Tiff, Tga]
  - Models as [Cast, OBJ, XNALara, SMD, CoD XModel, Maya, FBX].
  - Animations as [Cast].
  - Raw Files as-is.
    - Hunter will decompile binary graph objects to their 'light' text format on export.

> **NOTE:** This tool only exports assets as-is, without attempting to link models to their materials because not all games actually use materials for asset. The game uses complex scene graphs which would require too much effort to automate, however, most of a model's textures have similar names to each other. It's very easy to locate the textures for a model yourself.

> **NOTE:** There is no need to open the `sdf_streaming` toc file, as it only references assets in the main toc file.
