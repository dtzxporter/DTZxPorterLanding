## 👉 Usage:
Read the new game tools tutorial: [Game Tool Tutorial](https://dtzxporter.com/game-tools-tutorial).

> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the base folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

> **NOTICE:** The first time you attempt to load a file, the tool may take a long time to load depending on your drive performance. As long as the program is still loading, just wait it out. After this, a cache will be built and it will load faster until the next time you restart your machine.
