# Colossus - The Wolfenstein Asset Extractor
Extracts all assets from the games "Wolfenstein New Order", "Wolfenstein Old Blood", "Wolfenstein New Colossus" and "Wolfenstein Young Blood". This software was developed by [DTZxPorter](https://twitter.com/dtzxporter) & id-daemon.

## 💾 Download and version info:

> **IMPORTANT:** This software comes with no warranty what so ever. Use at your own risk.

- Download (Windows x64): [Colossus (v2.29)](https://mega.nz/file/JERCiS4T#O9FPvRCqJwlbQ7EMiI298xjO5WxSfbZhyw0mwKGg8Qg).
  - Windows 10+ officially supported.

## 👉 Usage:
Read the new game tools tutorial: [Game Tool Tutorial](https://dtzxporter.com/game-tools-tutorial).

> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the base folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

> **NOTICE:** The first time you attempt to load a file, the tool may take a long time to load depending on your drive performance. As long as the program is still loading, just wait it out. After this, a cache will be built and it will load faster until the next time you restart your machine.

## ⚙️ Ripping:
- The **.index**/**.resources** files contain various encoded assets that Colossus can export; and, as of now the currently supported assets are:
  - Textures as [Dds, Png, Tiff, Tga]
  - Models as [Cast, OBJ, XNALara, SMD, CoD XModel, Maya, FBX].
  - Animations as [Cast].
  - Worlds as [Cast].
  - Sounds as [Wav, Flac, Wem, Bnk].
    - `Wav/Flac` for WNO/WOB sounds.
    - `Wem/Bnk` for WNC/WYB sounds.
  - Raw Files as-is.

> **NOTICE:** World materials for WNO/WOB are exported in udim format. They are extremely large and require a lot of disk space and memory to use properly. Some software may handle them better than others.
