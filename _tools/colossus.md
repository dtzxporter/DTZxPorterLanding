# Colossus - The Wolfenstein Asset Extractor
Extracts all assets from the games "Wolfenstein New Order", "Wolfenstein Old Blood", "Wolfenstein New Colossus" and "Wolfenstein Young Blood". This software was developed by [DTZxPorter](https://twitter.com/dtzxporter) & id-daemon.

## üíæ Download and version info:

> **IMPORTANT:** This software comes with no warranty what so ever. Use at your own risk.

- Download (Windows x64): [Colossus (v2.23)](https://mega.nz/file/kJgD2A4B#8ZdmsIhJ1b0I-5zzoJNPiMZgwOeNAZPVNud9dQrCfF0).
  - Windows 10+ officially supported.

## üëâ Usage:
Read the new game tools tutorial: [Game Tool Tutorial](https://dtzxporter.com/game-tools-tutorial).

> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the base folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

> **NOTICE:** The first time you attempt to load a file, the tool may take a long time to load depending on your drive performance. As long as the program is still loading, just wait it out. After this, a cache will be built and it will load faster until the next time you restart your machine.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Ripping:
