# Diver - The Helldivers 2 Asset Extractor
Extracts all assets from the game "Helldivers 2". This software was developed by [DTZxPorter](https://twitter.com/dtzxporter).

## ❤️ Donate:
- I take time out of my day to make this happen.
- Show your support: [HERE](https://dtzxporter.com/donate)

## 💾 Download and version info:

> **IMPORTANT:** This software comes with no warranty what so ever. Use at your own risk.

- Download (Windows x64): [Diver (v1.55)](https://mega.nz/file/FJRlQaAJ#ay4szboaWjWnfTcPciFVbZbB-_-IS-aKBtV8XPq2miY).
  - Windows 10+ officially supported.

## 👉 Usage:
Read the new game tools tutorial: [Game Tool Tutorial](https://dtzxporter.com/game-tools-tutorial).

> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the data folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way. Diver loads all of the files in the data folder at once after picking a file to load.

## ⚙️ Ripping:
- The **.stream** and **.gpu_resources** files contain various encoded assets that Diver can export; and, as of now the currently supported assets are:
  - Textures as [Dds, Png, Tiff, Tga]
  - Models as [Cast, OBJ, XNALara, SMD, CoD XModel, Maya, FBX].
  - Animations as [Cast].
  - Worlds as [Cast].
  - Sounds as [Wav, Flac, Bnk].
  - Raw Files as-is.

> **NOTE:** This tool does it's best to export known materials with a model. In some cases, the models use dynamic shaders, and materials (for skins, variants, etc) and you won't get textures with that model. You can export materials separately as well as images.

## 📋 Asset Names:
There is a community effort to name assets for easier use. You can download or contribute to the database here: [hd2-name-db](https://github.com/dtzxporter/hd2-name-db).
