# Legion - The Apex Legends Asset Extractor
Extracts various assets from the game "Apex Legends". This software is developed by [DTZxPorter](https://twitter.com/dtzxporter) & id-daemon.

## üíæ Download and version info:

> **IMPORTANT:** By downloading this software you are agreeing to the **EULA** located inside of the archive (EULA.txt).

- Download Link: [Legion (v2.43)](https://mega.nz/file/sMBzGYTR#j2TLjuXbHrWhN2J99ZwyhEkZkCKi6_GWt-M0QIWJbrA).
- Download Link (TF2 Supported) *NOT FOR APEX*: [Legion Legacy (v2.13)](https://mega.nz/file/4NJSyQyA#4B-XEiAOujpWsECRHsxHwT9PzL_OUY8X9Rf56JA2KYA)
- Open source (Legion development discontinued): [Github](https://github.com/dtzxporter/Legion)
- Requires Visual Studio 2022 x64 Redist: [Redist](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/VC_redist.x64.exe).

## üëâ Usage:
Using Legion is fairly simple as the tool only requires the files located within "Apex\paks\Win64" in order to function.

- The tool features a user interface, just open up an MBnk or RPak to extract assets using `Load File`.

> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the Win64 folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Ripping:
- The **.rpak** files contain various encoded assets that Legion can export; and, as of now the currently supported assets are:
  - Textures as [Dds, Png, Tiff]
  - Models as [SEModel, OBJ, XNALara, SMD, CoD XModel, Maya (Legacy), FBX, Cast].
  - Animations as [SEAnim, Cast].
- The **.mbnk** file contains all the audio for the game:
  - Sounds as [Wav].
- The **.bsp** files (located inside *.vpk files) contain the map geometry:
  - See `Maps` below:

## üó∫Ô∏è Maps:
Map ripping is supported but not support will be provided, YMMV.
  - Geometry as [all model formats, see above ^]
  - See [Mprt importer (Blender)](https://github.com/llennoco22/Apex-mprt-importer-for-Blender) plugin for blender (Models / static props).
  - See <a href="{{ '/wiki/apps/Blender-Perf-Patch.html' | relative_url }}">Blender Performance Patch</a> to improve blender import performance.
  - You must load the map's base *.rpak file first.

## üíª Command line:
- Legion supports a single command line automation flag:
  - `--export` "file path" Loads and exports assets based on Legion settings.
  
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice:
- SE* formats (SEModel, SEAnim are preferred over any other export format and have guaranteed compatibility).
- Legion is considered *feature* complete, and will only receive updates that improve compatibility with new seasons.

## üìå Versioning:
- 2.43 - Fix crash on mid season update Rpaks.
- 2.42 - Fixed crash with '4' Rpaks.
- 2.41 - Added ability to load multiple (up to 4) Rpaks at once to support cross Rpak assets (New to the newer apex seasons). Will use much more memory in general.
