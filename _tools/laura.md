## 💾 Download and version info:

> **IMPORTANT:** This software comes with no warranty what so ever. Use at your own risk.

- Download (Windows x64): [Laura (v3.28)](https://mega.nz/file/oFxlzbJD#pJG1VJdMEPT5KvbeLEdxDe7k86ryAiPtolWDZSaEsXc).
  - Windows 10+ officially supported.

## 👉 Usage:
Read the new game tools tutorial: [Game Tool Tutorial](https://dtzxporter.com/game-tools-tutorial).

> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the base folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

> **NOTICE:** The first time you attempt to load a file, the tool may take a long time to load depending on your drive performance. As long as the program is still loading, just wait it out. After this, a cache will be built and it will load faster until the next time you restart your machine.

## ⚙️ Ripping:
- The **.tangoresource**/**.ptr** files contain various encoded assets that Laura can export; and, as of now the currently supported assets are:
